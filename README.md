# ComdirectAPI

This is a Swift library to access bank acounts of comdirect Bank AG.
To use it, one must have an account there and be registered as developer.

**NOTE:**
Before using this library, be sure to read the Comdirect REST API Documentation, which is available, once one is registered as developer.

**Be aware of the limits for fetching TAN challenges and entering possibly incorrect TAN values, as crossing a certain threshold will disable access to your account!**
